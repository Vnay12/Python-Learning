COMMON STRING METHODS

1) len()
s = " vinayNaik"
print(len(s))


2) upper() and lower()
s = " vinayNaik"
print(s.upper())
or 
print(s.lower())


3) strip()   # it removes leading and trailing whites spaces ( blank spaces)
s = "   VinayNaik   " 
print(s.strip())


4) replace()   # syntax for replace("old word", " new word" )
s = " python is fun " 
print(s.replace("fun", "easy"))


5) repeat()     # we dont have to add method name instead use multiplication sign " * " 
s = " vinaynaik"
print(s * 4)


6) title()  # for camel casing. it converts the first charc into upper and then rest lower
s = " VINAY " 
print(s.title())

7) swapcase()  # swap the cases into the opposite one 
s="VINAY"
print(s.swapcase())

8) capitalize()  # just converts the first charc of the string 
s = " we are family "
print(s.capitalize())
# output: " We are family "


9) casefold()  
# used to convert string into lower case. similar to lower() 
# if any other language is used like beta sign, alpha sign it will lower it down

s = " ÃŸ " 
print(s.casefold())

# output : " SS "  


10) center() 
it is used to center the string for example mkaing table header or something 

s1 = "hello"
s2 = s1.center(s1)
print(s2)

# output :        hello        
# there are blank spaces in width of 20 


>> we can pass length and chars to be filled 

a = "hello"
b = a.center(20, '-')  # default value is 20
print(b)

# output : -------hello--------



11) count() 
>>it returns the number of times a specified substring appears in a string
>> it is commanly used to analysis or char frequence in the string

s = " mississipiwee"
result = s.count(s)
print(result)

>> its return type is int and hence we have to store the value

>> syntax : string.count(substring, start = 0, end = len(s))
we can also mention start and end and default is starting from 0 till end 


12) encode()  


13) endswith() 
>> for checkingthe string ending with substring mentioned. 
>> it is used to check / analysis 

s = "vinaynaik"
result = s.endswith("naik")
print(result)

# output : True


14) expandtabs()


15) find()
>> the find() method of string will return the first value of searched substring
>> syntax : s.find(substring, start, end)
substring: The substring to search for within the main string s.
start (optional): The starting index from where to begin the search.
end (optional): The ending index where the search should stop.

s = " abc bca wab" 
result = s.find("bca")



16) format() and format_map()

17) index()
>> it is used to find the substring and is similar to find() but will produce error if it dsnt find substring


18) isalnum()
>> it checks if all the charc in the string is alpha number that is either letters or numbers or both 
>> if yes then returns ture or false 

s = " python124"
result = s.isalnum()

# output : True


18) isalpha() 
>> it is used to check if all the charc is alphabets 
>> true if all alphabets or false if space, numbers or special 

s1 = "HelloWorld"
res1 = s1.isalpha()
print(res1)
# output : true
s2 = "Hello123"
res2 = s2.isalpha()
print(res2)
# output : false


19) isdecimal() 
>> it is as same as isalpha but only difference is it checks all numbers 

20) isdigit()


21) join()
>> it is used to concat the string 
>> syntax : separator.join(iterable)
>> separator: The string placed between elements of the iterable.
iterable: A sequence of strings (e.g., list, tuple etc) to join together.

s = " python is fun "
result = " ".join(s)  # seprate is blank space between the substring



22) split()

it will split the string into multiple string breaking the given string by the specified separator 

a = " Vinay is a good boy "
words = a.split()
