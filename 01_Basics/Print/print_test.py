# Write a Python program to print numbers from 1 to 5 on the same line, separated by a comma.

one = 1
two = 2
three = 3
four = 4
five = 5

print(one, two, three, four, five, sep=", ")


# How can you use sep to join and print multiple strings with a specific delimiter, such as |?

name = "John"
age = 23
address = "123 Main St"

print(name, age, address, sep=" | ")


# Use a combination of sep and end to print the following pattern: A-B-C-

A = "A"
B = "B"
C = "C"

print(A, B, C, sep="-", end="-")


# Write a Python program to print the following: Hello-World-Python!

A = " Hello"
B = "World"
C = "Python"

print(A,B,C, sep='-', end='!')


# Write a Python script to print the following without using a loop: 
# 1 2 3 4 5
# 6 7 8 9 10

print("1 2 3 4 5")
print("6 7 8 9 10")
