# if else in one line 

number = -2

result = "Positive" if number >= 0 else "Negative"
print(result)

syntax : we have to store it in variable and then if else live above 


# match number is like switch case in python 

number = 2 

match number: 
    case 1:
        print 
    case 2 | 3: 
        print
    case _:                 # this is default case if no other case is matched
        print
